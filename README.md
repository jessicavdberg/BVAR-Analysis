# BVAR-Analysis

Forecasting macroeconomic variables are critical for developing policies. This paper sets out to forecast real GDP growth in South Africa by using a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) using data from 1980:Q3 to 2009:Q2. BVAR models are used to avoid problems of multicollinearity and over parameterization that occur with the classical vector autoregression models. The results from the model confirm the accuracy of BVAR models for forecasting key macroeconomic variables, such as economic growth
